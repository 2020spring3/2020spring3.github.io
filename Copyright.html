        <p>Imagine putting a lot of effort into creating something just for someone to claim it is theirs after you finish. This is what copyright prevents. Copyright protects other people from stealing your work and you from stealing others work. It may seem very strict at first, but as the internet grows, so does the amount of work people put into it. If you are not careful crediting someone else's work it can put you in some very big financial trouble. It is very important to have a good sense of what Copyright is when going on the internet to prevent this from happening. This website is a scavenger hunt about copyright and what to look for in a website to obey copyright laws.
