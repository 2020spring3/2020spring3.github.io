			<p>At it's core Social Media is essientally a form of long distance communication that can be seen publically. Since it can be defined so broadly some may say the first form of it was in 1792, when the telegraph was invented. The first public website that allowed you to do things such as make a profile and add friends was called "Six Degrees" and was created in 1997. In 1999 "blogging" started to become a trend and led many new forms of social media that are still used today.</p>
