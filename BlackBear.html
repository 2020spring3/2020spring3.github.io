      <p class="body">The black bear is one of the biggest animals in the woods of Connecticut. Odds are you probably will not run into one but it's important to know what to do if you encounter one just incase. Most people thinking acting big and intimidating will scare them off but that in fact is one of the quickest ways to die since they will see that as you are challenging them to a fight, which you will probably not win. What you should do is slowly back away while constantly talking in a calm way. This will make sure the bear knows where you are so you cannot frighten it and get attacked. You should do this until it is out of viewing distance but keep in mind the bear will follow you since they are curious animals. As long as you don't do anything aggressively towards it, it will not attack you.</p>
