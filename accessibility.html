			<p>Many people are not fortunate enough to have the simple skills in life we take for granted. Whatever disability they may have that gives them a disadvantage should be accounted for while accessing the internet. This includes how they search the web and websites themselves having ways for all viewers to enjoy their content. The internet is a place where everyone must work together to help make it a better place. Here are some links that can help you traverse the internet.</p>

			<h2 class="headers">How to make your Website More Accessible</h2>
			<p>When making your own website it can be easy to forget that other people may want to use your website too but cannot do it without assistance even if it is a crucial step to making one. Always try to have an organized structure when making a website so it easy to find the needed information. All your information should also be accessible through the keyboard in case the user does not have or cannot use a mouse. When putting images on your site, always remember to add an alt tag with a description of the picture so people using screen readers can tell what the picture is of. It may also be tempting but refrain from using crazy background and font colors since sometimes they can make it very hard to read. If your website is rather long it may also be a good idea to put an arrow at the bottom of the page to send the user back to the top.</p>
