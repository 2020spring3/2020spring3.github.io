      <p class="body">The White-Tailed Deer will be the most common large animal you will see in Connecticut. They generally leave you alone and will run away once they notice you. While running they attract the predator with their tail so the predator will strike their non-vital organs. These kinds of deer are commonly seen as pests since they eat nearly every plant and they take away food from other animals in the ecosystem. They also change skin color throughout the year to blend in with their environments.</p>
