      <p class="body">The Gray Squirrel is most likely going to be the animal you see the most in Connecticut. They are everywhere in trees and if you listen around you will probably hear them squeaking in the trees. Think of Gray Squirrels as tree rats since that's basically what they are. They are most famous for eating nuts but their appetite also consists of bird eggs and meat whenever they come across it. Most of the time if you approach one it will run away up a tree, but on the rare occurrence it doesn't, keep your distance since it will probably try to bite you instead.
