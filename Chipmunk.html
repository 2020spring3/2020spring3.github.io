      <p class="body">The north american five-lined chipmunk is another rodent you will see a lot in Connecticut besides the gray squirrel. Chipmunks are eaten by almost every animal that eats meat in the area therefore they will run away from you on sight. They are basically the chicken nugget of the woods since everyone loves them. Chipmunks make their homes in holes in the ground and also in stone walls which are quite abundant in Connecticut. They are very organized creatures and their burrows have separate rooms for different purposes. For example, they keep their food in a different place than where they sleep or go to the bathroom.</p>
